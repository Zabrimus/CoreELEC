# VDR
VDR and plugins are integrated into the build system of CoreELEC to be able to start and use VDR and to be able to easily switch between VDR and KODI.

It's possible to either create a VDR tar.gz only, which contains VDR, all plugins and all dependant libraries.<br>
The second possibility is to create a CoreELEC image which contains VDR and plugins.


This is still work in progress...
